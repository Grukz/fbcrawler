For it to be effective & show you personally \"checking in\" at Standing Rock, do this (just sharing my post does not serve the intention): On your wall- where it says, \"What's on your mind\". Make sure you select public- it gets more \"hits\" & visibility. Write a message & at the bottom you'll see a check in icon, type in Standing Rock & a number of selections show.

For it to be effective & show you personally \"checking in\" at Standing Rock, do this (just sharing my post does not serve the intention): On your wall- where it says, \"What's on your mind\". Make sure you select public- it gets more \"hits\" & visibility. Write a message & at the bottom you'll see a check in icon, type in Standing Rock & a number of selections show.

For it to be effective & show you personally \"checking in\" at Standing Rock, do this (just sharing my post does not serve the intention): On your wall- where it says, \"What's on your mind\". Make sure you select public- it gets more \"hits\" & visibility. Write a message & at the bottom you'll see a check in icon, type in Standing Rock & a number of selections show.
